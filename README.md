End-to-End Supermarket Sales Analysis
Author: Ash.
1. Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the "Supermarket Sales" dataset sourced from Kaggle. The primary goal is to transform raw transactional data into actionable business insights that can guide strategic decisions for revenue growth. From a data analyst's perspective, this project demonstrates the complete workflow: from secure data acquisition and cleaning to exploratory analysis, visualization, and final recommendations.

The analysis answers critical business questions, such as:

What are the top-performing product categories by revenue and sales volume?

What are the daily sales trends over time?

How do different product lines compare in terms of average price and total revenue?

2. Dataset Information
This project uses the Supermarket Sales Dataset, which captures detailed transaction records from a supermarket chain in Myanmar across three cities: Yangon, Naypyitaw, and Mandalay. It provides a comprehensive view of sales activities, customer demographics, and payment methods from January to March 2019.

Source: Kaggle Dataset Link

Format: CSV

Number of Records: 1000

Number of Columns: 17

Column Descriptions
Invoice ID: A unique identifier for each transaction.

Branch & City: Location of the supermarket.

Customer Type: 'Member' or 'Normal' customer.

Gender: Gender of the customer.

Product Line: The category of the product sold.

Unit Price & Quantity: Price per unit and number of items purchased.

Total: Total transaction amount including a 5% tax.

Date & Time: Date and time of the transaction.

Payment: Payment method used (Cash, Ewallet, Credit card).

cogs: Cost of goods sold.

gross income: Profit from each transaction.

Rating: Customer satisfaction rating (out of 10).

3. Technologies & Libraries Used
Python 3.x

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

mlcroissant: For programmatically loading the dataset metadata.

KaggleHub: For authenticating with and downloading data from Kaggle.

4. Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project environment on your local machine.

Step 4.1: Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or newer installed.

You will need a Kaggle account and an API token.

Step 4.2: Clone the Repository
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-directory>

Step 4.3: Set Up Kaggle API Authentication
For the script to download the dataset, you need to authenticate with Kaggle. The most reliable method is to use a kaggle.json API token file.

Go to your Kaggle account settings page (https://www.kaggle.com/<your-username>/account).

Click on "Create New API Token". This will download a kaggle.json file.

Place this file in the correct directory:

Windows: C:\Users\<Your-Username>\.kaggle\

macOS / Linux: ~/.kaggle/

The script will automatically detect this file and use it for authentication.

Step 4.4: Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python libraries using the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

5. How to Run the Analysis
Once the setup is complete, you can run the analysis by executing the main Python script from your terminal:

python Supermarket_Analysis.py

The script will run from start to finish, printing the analysis steps to the console and generating output files in the project directory.

6. Output Files
The script will generate four new files in your project folder:

important_sales.csv: A simplified CSV containing only the most essential columns (Invoice_ID, Date, Product_line, Total).

large_quantity_sales.csv: A filtered CSV containing only transactions where 5 or more items were purchased.

revenue_by_product_line.png: A bar chart visualizing the total revenue generated by each product line.

daily_revenue_over_time.png: A line chart showing the trend of total revenue on a daily basis.

7. Summary of Findings
The analysis reveals several key business insights:

Top Categories: 'Food and beverages' and 'Sports and travel' are the highest revenue-generating categories. These should be a primary focus for marketing efforts and inventory management.

Volume vs. Revenue: While 'Electronic accessories' sell in high quantities, their overall contribution to revenue is lower. This suggests a potential strategy to upsell or bundle higher-margin products in this category.

Sales Fluctuations: Daily revenue data shows significant peaks and troughs. Further analysis could correlate these fluctuations with specific days of the week, holidays, or marketing promotions to optimize staffing and campaigns.
